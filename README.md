This repository contains the code and resources for predicting, analyzing, and preventing crime in a major city. The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques and data analysis to provide insights into crime patterns and facilitate proactive measures for crime prevention.

Features
Utilizes historical crime data to build predictive models
Identifies patterns and trends in crime occurrences
Generates visualizations for better understanding and analysis
Offers insights for effective resource allocation and deployment of law enforcement
Suggests proactive measures for crime prevention
Tech Stack
The project is built using the following technologies:

Python: The primary programming language for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing tasks.
NumPy: Employed for numerical computations and array operations.
Scikit-learn: Utilized for machine learning algorithms and predictive modeling.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for creating visualizations to present the findings effectively.
GeoPandas and Folium: Employed for handling geospatial data and generating interactive maps.
AWS or Google Cloud Platform: May be used for scalable computing and storage, depending on the project's requirements.
